# tracking-covid
It's a  tracking app for COVID-19. It's react based. And moreover able to send mail to the user  who subscribes the app. This whole application also uses MERN full stack.
While making this application MongoDB comes as the database part. I use React in the frontend. And Node.js in bacckend where I use concurrently, axios, nodemailer these kinds of libraries.
